# Create a class for representing any 2-D point or vector. The methods inside this class include
# its magnitude and its rotation with respect to the X-axis. Using the objects define functions for
# calculating the distance between two vectors, dot product, cross product of two vectors. Extend
# the 2-D vectors into 3-D using the concept of inheritance. Update the methods according to 3-
# D.
